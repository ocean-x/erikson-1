The project is about putting together an underwater remotely operated vehicle with the purpose of aquatic data collection. This project had been chosen because of the recent death of many fishes in the school pond. The reason why this project is important is because upon its completion, we will be provided the means for the convenient monitoring of underwater data such as pH level and water temperature, which are the two areas the data collection aspect of our project will focus on. Remembering the algae blooming in 2014 and 2015, we have found out that hot environment could cause eutrophication, which will lead to algae bloom. Thus, monitoring the condition of the pond would be able to alert us when it gets too undesirable. We hope to achieve the prevention of a repeat of another incident involving the death of our school's fishes.
