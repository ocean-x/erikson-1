## Potential Improvements

We've wrote at length about the improvements we want to see with future
iterations of our ROV. After the judging and presenting process at the VJC
Science Fair, we've learnt many things about where the ROV can be further
developed. The wisdom we have gained are distilled below. 

The judge asked us what we could improve upon our ROV such that it can be
pitched to a government agency or a statuory board such as the Public Utilities
Board (PUB) to be used in our waters. 

These ROVs can be used for observation and for data collection, especially
because the conditions of the water can change drastically from one region to
another. Then the first question we have to ask ourselves is this: is our ROV
sea-worthy?

We have not given much consideration to the ROV's performance at extreme depths
and ranges. Heck, we didn't even consider it's performace due to it's center of
mass. To work on this, the first thing we have to do is find a mentor that is
willing to help us make a sea-worthy vehicle. 

This requires an in-depth understanding of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, the
use of CAD software and advanced milling techniques to fabricate parts we need,
along with the software and mathematics to simulate the pressure on the various
parts of the hull. 

And this means we are moving from mere exploration, to engineering a product
that has to meet client, environmental and safety expectations. 

### Saltwater or freshwater?

The presence of a high concentration of electrolytes, means that we have more to
think about before building our ROV. Longevity of such a vehicle is a question,
due to factors such a corrosion that could happen on the boat. The brushless
motors we are using may malfunction due to the electrical conductivity of the
water. We may have to innovate and develop ways of potting and isolating our
electrical systems, something that is easier said than done. 

### Tether

The tether is the next big question on our list. This is because a tether is
literally the greatest range limitation if we are to deploy this to a reservoir.
Our 15m tether would eliminate much of its operating depth. However, radio waves
cannot penetrate through water as a medium. And because radio is the most common
choice of wireless transmission in other remotely operated vehicles, such as
drones, we have difficulties finding alternatives, which may be expensive and
hard to use.

Another problem we have with the tether, is what will happen when
our ROV fails. At this juncture, it is still possible to pull it out of the
water with the tether. Without this physical connection, we must come up with
subroutines that aid the recovery of the vessel, or the data collected by it, as
soon as a structural failure has been detected. 

The elimination of a tether and establishing wireless connectivity is a
difficult task, but will signify our ability to pitch the product to clients.
