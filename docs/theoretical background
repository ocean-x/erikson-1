Before the purchase of materials, there were some calculation made to ensure all the parts fits together perfectly. For example, there was the calculation for upward thrust using the Archimedes Principle that thrust = acceleration due to gravity x Volume of the displaced fluid x (density of fluid - density of body). To avoid the turning effect while travelling in a straight line, the two forward motors are place alingh in a horizontal line to the centre of mass.
