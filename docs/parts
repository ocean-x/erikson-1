For now, the ROV can collect data 
of Water Temperature and pH Level.

It will be linked to the
sensors and plot a 
graph to find the 
trend of pH Level
and water Temperature.

There are power requirements to be met. A battery 
or batteries must be sufficient for motor control 
and the core computing devices. In the case there 
is mains electricity nearby, we cannot discount the 
possibility that we just attach a 12V/3A breakout to 
power the setup.

The Arduino will execute
the code to operate
the 6 motors.

The 9-axis motor driver board navigation telemetry, 
which are the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer.
