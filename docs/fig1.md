From Fig. 1, we are able to compare that the 
water quality of the pond is slight too alkaline for 
the fishes such as Pacu, Koi and Silver Arowana. 
At the same time, the sea water seems to have the
optimun condition for algae bloom which is why 
most cases of algae bloom happen in the sea and 
the reason why there is no algae bloom could be 
that the waves distur the water constant such 
that the water is not stagnant for algae bloom.
