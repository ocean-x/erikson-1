From Fig. 2, it is interesting to find out how low the
water temperature could be during the recent rainy
weather. According to research, the optimum 
temperature for algae bloom is about 25 degree
celcius. Therefore, during rainy season, the water 
could be lower, thus, having a better evironment
for algae growth.
