This is a project that hopes to create an affordable remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to frequently monitor water bodies. It aims to alleviate the damage caused by harmful algal blooms through alerting the fish farmers of inclement aquatic conditions. Such conditions are characterised by alkaline pH levels of about 8.2 to 8.8 with warm temperatures between 25 to 30 degree Celsius.

The process of creating the ROV included relevant technologies such as the use of the Arduino platform and the C programming language. Additionally, it requires an understanding of electronics and practical skills such as soldering and working with PVC and acrylic. 

Through the process of creating our own ROV, we now have a customisable platform to navigate and detect the conditions of water bodies. Using the school pond as a sample testbed, we have proven its ability to report the condition of the aquatic habitat to users.
