It is through this research we learn more about the biological condition for algae bloom and the assembly of a remotely operated underwater vehicle. The experience of analysising the data and find out the 
possible reasons for the unexpected phenomenon further taught us biology is to be study with the bigger picture of the open system of the ecology. For now, it would be consider successful for the remotely
operated underwater vehicle to report to us the condition of the water body. Further refinement of the project could be a camera to take picture from the water of the surface of water to check for light
exposure level and dissovled oxygen level in the water. All this will proide more insight and to protect the fishes that we hold dear to.
