# erikson-1
An aquatic remotely-operated vehicle, currently in initial development. 
We began developing and building the first iteration of our ROV at the beginning of June 2016. We intend to present a stable version of the vessel at the Victoria Junior College Science Fair during the same year. 

The repository wiki will be where we record our planning and thoughts throughout the development and building process. 

Our team members include Wayne, Rubesh, Wazir and Ivan. 

## Engineering goals

* Raspberry Pi and Arduino
* Waterproofed main housing
* Six thrusters (2 horizontal, 4 vertical)
* Effective depth of up to 2.4m
* Effective range of up to 15m
* Solid ballasts

This iteration will be controlled by a Raspberry Pi acting as the 'host' computer, with the Arduino acting as the motor controller. The CAT5 tether connecting the ROV to the base station is 15m long. 

Future iterations, will contain a live video and telemetry feed. This will be chiefly managed by the Raspberry Pi. Telemetry will include sensors and navigation equipement.

### Navigation

* Compass
* Accelerometer
* Gyroscope

### Telemetry

* Video feed
* Temperature
* pH sensor
* Oxygen sensor
* Salinity sensor
* Alcohol sensor (possibly)

We hope that future versions will be able to include more sophisticated technologies such as GPS, leak detection, and fluid ballasts.
